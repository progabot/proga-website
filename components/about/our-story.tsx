            Proga Tech is a Ukraine-based company born during the war, a time of
            chaos and uncertainty. While the world was standing still, we chose
            to begin.

            Our first external hiring experience was tough and disappointing.
            But it taught us what truly matters: people, culture, and shared
            values. That's why we focus on growing talent from within while
            staying open to rare gems who align with our mission.
