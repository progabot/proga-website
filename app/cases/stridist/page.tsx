          Fitness and nutrition coaches often face challenges in managing their
          clients, creating personalized programs, tracking progress, and
          handling administrative tasks efficiently. Many rely on a fragmented
          set of tools, leading to inefficiencies, increased costs for both
          coaches and their clients. The core challenge was to consolidate these
          disparate functions into a single, intuitive, and powerful platform
          that caters specifically to the needs of fitness professionals.
